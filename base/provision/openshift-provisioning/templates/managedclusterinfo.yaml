kind: ManagedClusterInfo
metadata:
  # This object is created by RHACM and it is created with a app.kubernetes.io/instance label attached to it.
  # RHACM adds this label to the ManagedClusterInfo object likely because a parent object was labeled using
  # this label and the labels are just copied to the child objects. The parent object was labeled by Argo CD.
  # The app.kubernetes.io/instance label is used by Argo CD to mark objects under its management. If the object
  # has this label, Argo CD will assume that it is an object that it manages. Because this object didn't exist
  # in the git repository, Argo CD displayed this object as out of sync. The purpose of this ManagedClusterInfo
  # object is to avoid Argo CD showing this object as out of sync.
